 # QJM Wargame Rules
 from pp 208-210 from Numbers, Prediction and War by Trevor N. Dupuy

 ## I. Campaign Scenario Procedures
 ### A.  INITIAL REQUIREMENTS
 1. Force inventory both sides, to include starting locations of all units, with the unit weapons and equipment translated into the OLI values and related inputs to QJM
 2. Terrain, to include such major terrain features as mountains, cities, and towns, roads, rivers,
       and the entire area for each campaign categories in terms of the fourteen basic QJM terrain
       characteristics, or combinations thereof.
 3. Defensive works, to include field fortifications, minefields, major antitank ditches, etc, located
       with considerable precision on the map.
 4. Offensive plans in terms of:
    1. Overall force objectives:
        1. Geographical locations
           - immediate;
           - intermediate (one or more), and
           - final;
        2. time;
        3. force relationships with enemy and friendly forces
    2. Similar objectives for all component elements, down to and including divisions;
    3. Planned axes of advance of FEBA and reserve units;
    4. Contingencies for commitment of reserves.

 ### B. ANTICIPATED SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS, ATTACKING DIVISION
 1. Movement to first hostile contact at rate indicated in rules for rate of advance
 2. Preliminary QJM analysis (if necessary) to determine if opposition is of sufficient significance to
      start an engagement, or whether advance continues under circumstances of negligible or slight opposition.
      a. Force strength is calculated by:
          S = ((Ws + Wmg + Whw) * r_n) + (Wgi * rn) + ((Wg + Wgy) * (rwg * hwg * zwg * wyg)) + (Wi * rwi * hwi) + (Wy * rwy * hwy * zyw * wyy)
          Ws: Small arms
          Wmg: machine guns
          Whw: heavy weapons
          Wgi: Antitank weapons, full value is included only up to the total OLI value of hosilte armored weapons (Wi), excess is halved
          Wg: artillery
          Wgy: Antiair weapons, full value is included only up to the total OLI value of hostile aircraft (Wy), excess is halved
          Wi: Armoured vehicles
          Wy: CAS contribution, aircraft weapons. If Air firepower is greater than sum of all ground power (Ws+Wmy+Whw+Wgi+Wg+Wgy+Wi) only half excess is counted.
                Maximum 3x sum of ground firepower.
 3. At first encountered hostile defense position, QJM analysis; from this the following will be determined:
    1. Outcome, on basis of P/P ratio:
        1. If P/P facors defender, advance stops at FEBA, thus established;
        2. If P/P favors attacker, advance continues at rate set in rules.
    2. Duration of engagement:
        1. If P/P favors defender, engagement lasts two days, losses are calculated, and there is no further
        significant action (until or unless one side or the other is reinforced); loss rates are thereafter
        calcul;ated daily at "holding" rate;
        2. If P/P favors attacker, engagement ends when:
            - attacker advances through depth of defensive position; defender breaks off and withdraws;
            - either defender or attacker recieves reinforcements of 20% or more
            - at the end of five days if none of the above have occured.
            In that case there is no further significant action until one side or the other is reinforced;
            loss rates are therefore calculated at "holding" rate.
    3. Distance advanced during engagement.
    4. Total personnel losses during engagement.
    5. Total armor loss during engagement.
    6. Total artillery loss during engagement.
 4. If defender is successful, or if attacker does not gain objective within five days, an inactive "holding"
  situation exists until one side or the other initiates a new engagement by an attack.
 5. If attacker is successful, he moves to contact on the next defensive position at thebrate prescribed for
  movement against Moderate, Slight, or Negligible Resistance, dependant on the following:
    1. If the defender adopts "delay" posture, attacker's rate is against Moderate or Slight Resistance, with 
        attacker's P/P arbitrarily doubled during period of movement only.
    2. If defender elects withdrawal, his rate and that of the attacker are those for movement against Negligible
        Resistance.
 6. Exhaustion and recovery rates will be calculated for the period between engagements, to arrive at an [ex]
      (exhaustion) factor for each side for the subsequent engagement.
 7. At the next encounterd hostile defensive position, a new QJM analysis will be performed as for Step B (3) above.
 8. This procedure will continue until:
    1. Attacker reaches final objective.
    2. Attacker is stopped at an intermediate objective by a successful defense, or inability to take objective in a
     five-day battle (situation in Step B(4) above).
 ### C. ANTICIPATED SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS, ATTACKING CORPS OR ARMY
 1. All committed or first echelon divisions advance to first hostile contacts simulataneously. All supporting and
  reserve units also advance simultaneously at rates indicated for their axes of advance.
 2. Engagement outcomes and advance and attrition rates are calculated separately for each component division of the
  attacking force.
 3. Reserve units (divisions or major fractions thereof treated as independent units) may be committed by attacker or
  defender in a front-line division sector or between sectors.
 a. If between divisions, then new sector boundaries will be established and new QJM calculations will be based on
     these new sectors.
 b. If in the sector of a committed division, then the new QJM calculations may be for the two forces (original, plus
     reserve) in the previously established sector, or may be for two divisions separately.
 4. At the close of each day the locations of each attacking and defending unit (division or major fraction) will be
  plotted, whether these are involved in engagements or are between engagements.
 5. The corps or army is assumed to have achieved its objective when half of its component divisions have reached their
  terrain objectives, and no major defending reserves are immediately able to reverse the trend.
 6. For army group or theater forces, QJM calculations can be by corps or division, following the above procedures.

 ## II. Rules for Defensive Strength and Depth
 ### A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
 1. The maximum effective depth of a prepared or fortified defensive position cannot exceed 0.3x the depth component
  of the dispersion factor in meters; the maximum effective depth of a hasty defense position is 0.5x that of prepared
  or fortified defense.
 2. For calculation of overall preparation strength, when non-organic engineers are assigned to assist troops in
  position preparation, one engineer is assumed to be the equivalent of ten non-engineer troops.
 3. The depth of a subordinate command in an integrated defensive position will be that of the major unit (usually division).
### B. HASTY DEFENSE
 1. This condition exists when criteria for prepared defense have not been met.
 2. Depth of a hasty defense position begins at 0.5 x 0.00001N x depth component of dispersion factor in meters, and increases
  proportionally in ten days to a maximum of one-half of maximum effective depth (see A (1) above).
### C. PREPARED DEFENSE
 1. This condition exists:
    1. When front to be covered is less than one meter per man, and unit has been in position five days; depth of the position
     is then half of the maximum possible effective depth; after unit has been in position ten days, the depth equals the
     maximum possible effective depth.
    2. When front to be covered is greater than one meter per man and less than two meters per man, and unit has been in position
     ten days; depth of the position is then half of the maximum possible effective depth; after the unit has been in position
     twenty days, the depth equals the maximum possible effective depth.
 2. When the front to be covered is greater than two meters per man, prepared defense is not possible without additional
  (non-organic) engineer strength, to reach an effective preparation strength of more than one man per two meters of front.
 ### D. FORTIFIED DEFENSE
 1. Three times the preparation time required to achieve a prepared defense capability will provide a fortified defense.
 2. Under certain time circumstances part of a defensive position can be fortified and part prepared.
